# Book Recommendation System: Intelligent Content Discovery through Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This capstone project develops an intelligent book recommendation system using machine learning clustering techniques to analyze reading patterns and preferences. By leveraging the comprehensive Goodreads dataset, the system provides personalized book recommendations based on user preferences, reading history, and content similarity analysis.

## Business Problem

Book discovery and recommendation systems are crucial for the modern publishing and reading ecosystem:
- **Readers**: Overwhelmed by millions of available titles, need personalized discovery
- **Publishers**: Require data-driven insights for marketing and audience targeting
- **Bookstores/Platforms**: Need recommendation engines to increase engagement and sales
- **Authors**: Benefit from algorithmic promotion to reach appropriate audiences
- **Libraries**: Optimize collection development based on reading preferences

## Dataset Description

**Source:** Goodreads API via Kaggle  
**Size:** 11,127 books with comprehensive metadata  
**Scope:** Multi-language, multi-genre book catalog with reader engagement metrics

### Key Features:
- **Book Metadata**: Title, authors, ISBN, publication information
- **Reader Engagement**: Average ratings, ratings count, text reviews count
- **Content Information**: Number of pages, language, publisher
- **Quality Metrics**: Reader rating distributions and review volumes

### Data Quality Enhancements:
- **Author Standardization**: Consolidated variations (e.g., "J.K. Rowling-Mary GrandPrÃ©" â†’ "J.K. Rowling")
- **Language Unification**: Combined English variants (eng, en-US, en-GB, en-CA)
- **Missing Data Handling**: Strategic treatment of null values and inconsistent entries

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- **Data Cleaning**: Standardization of author names and language codes
- **Feature Extraction**: Numerical and categorical variable preparation
- **Correlation Analysis**: Understanding relationships between ratings, reviews, and engagement
- **Scaling and Normalization**: Preparation for clustering algorithms

### Unsupervised Learning Approach
- **Clustering Algorithms**: K-means, hierarchical clustering, and advanced techniques
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA for visualization and computational efficiency
- **Similarity Metrics**: Content-based and collaborative filtering approaches
- **Model Validation**: Silhouette analysis and cluster quality assessment

### Recommendation Engine Architecture
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Book characteristics and metadata analysis
- **Collaborative Filtering**: User behavior and rating pattern analysis
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combination of multiple recommendation strategies
- **Cold Start Solutions**: Recommendations for new users and new books
